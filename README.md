This is a personal portfolio website built with Ruby on Rails.  The aim being to showcase my coding skills and knowledge achieved throughout the Procoders course. The core tasks to be accomplished are:

* Write user stories for the various features.

* Set up a Scrum board within the Github repository.

* Namespace the admin routes,  secure with http basic auth & use environment variables with .env & detenv.

* Add models, controllers & views.

* Add feature & model tests for adding, editing & viewing posts/articles.

* Use Bootstrap 4 for admin views.

* Using a mobile-first approach to design & create 3 wireframes: mobile, tablet and desktop.

* Style the Rails views starting with mobile first using BEM, CSS class namespaces and SASS nesting.

* Use Postgresql as the database instead of sqlite.

* Create a Procfile.development file for web: and db:. Create a ./bin/boot file to run foreman for developing locally.

* Set up a Heroku app and use Codeship to deploy it automatically from the master branch.
